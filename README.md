# Adobe Behaviour and Content Simulation Challenge

Communication in the digital realm is a dynamic interplay between senders and receivers, with each message crafted to evoke specific user behaviors. For marketers, the ultimate goal is to understand and predict user engagement â€“ the likes, comments, shares, and purchases that define the success of their content.

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses face the ever-growing challenge of delivering exceptional customer experiences. Adobe Experience Cloud, a comprehensive suite of tools, stands at the forefront, empowering businesses to design and deliver outstanding customer journeys. A seamless and engaging customer journey not only drives user satisfaction but also plays a pivotal role in brand differentiation, market credibility, and overall business success.

This challenge presents two critical aspects of customer engagement:

### Tweet Likes Prediction
Predicting tweet likes accurately is essential for understanding user engagement. Given the content of a tweet (text, company, username, media URLs, timestamp), predict its user engagement, specifically the number of likes.

### Tweet Content Generation
Predicting tweet likes accurately is essential for understanding user engagement. Given tweet metadata (company, username, media URL, timestamp), generate the tweet text. This task delves into the art and science of crafting compelling content that resonates with the audience.
